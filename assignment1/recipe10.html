		<h1>&nbsp; &nbsp; Cut ¾ of the peeled beetroot into small dice (you may want to wear rubber gloves to do this) and set the rest aside. 
		<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; Melt the butter in a large pan, and then soften the onion over a gentle heat for 5 minutes.
		<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; Add the carrot, leek, celery, diced beetroot, allspice and bay leaf and stir well to coat with butter. 
		<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; Cook for another 10 minutes, adding a little stock if the vegetables begin to look dry.
		<br> 
		&nbsp; &nbsp; Meanwhile, grate the remaining beetroot.
		<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; Pour in the rest of the stock and the potatoes and simmer for 15 minutes, then add the cabbage, garlic and grated beetroot. 
		<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; Cook until all the vegetables are tender (about 10 minutes).
		<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; Add the vinegar, sugar, pepper and a pinch of salt and taste. 
		<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; Add a little more of any of these if necessary, then serve with a dollop of sour cream, a sprig of dill, and some Polish bread on the side.</h1>
