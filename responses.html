			<a href="https://nathan.tokyo" target="_blank">This</a> personal website acts as the owner’s resume and online portfolio. The website makes me feel adventurous and puts me in a fun mood because I am enticed to explore all the elements on the webpage. There is something very addictive about the elements on his webpage that make me want to keep on playing with them even if I know what will happen. The abundance of small animations which can be interacted with using our cursor tells me that the owner is a very playful person with a very good understanding of interactive design. The website feels ‘alive’ and the action of exploring his webpage allows us to explore his works and personality as well. I chose this website because I loved how each box/section has a different interaction that helps us understand the owner’s personality. I was attracted to the color scheme and the type as well.

			<u>“Metaphors We Live By”, George Lakoff and Mark Johnson</u>
			<br>
			In this short essay, the two authors explain how metaphors are used in our language as a way to understand an abstract concept through spatial or systemic associations. I found this piece really interesting as it dissects the ways we think and talk about concepts that we physically cannot experience. Metaphors are so fundamentally embedded in the way we think and act, I don’t consciously notice how it's rooted by culture. Relating the idea of spatial metaphors to the design of the web, it made me think of how natural cursor movements like “scrolling up” or  “dragging” were based on physical movements we make in real life. The movements we make on the trackpad or mouse physically corresponds in a way that makes sense to us, which is why these actions are easy to pick up. When it comes to designing a website, its “flow” comes into mind: does the website give you a “smooth” or “choppy” experience? To me, using flow as the metaphor for describing a website’s experience implies that a smooth experience is pleasant and efficient, whereas choppy is frustrating and unpleasant. These connotations must be concepts that I should be consciously aware of when designing websites to best articulate the website’s purpose.

			<u>“Metalogue: Why a Swan”, Gregory Bateson</u>
			<br>
			Through a conversation the author has with his daughter explaining what he means by “sort of”, Bateson touches on how different objects can be categorized into many subcategories only for them to be unconsciously fused together into one single meaning in our minds. The circular and constant jumping-back form of the conversation mirrors the topic of how to categorize something to find its meaning. I found this piece rather hard to read (I had to read it at least twice word by word before “sort of” understanding its bigger meaning and even then I don’t think I fully grasped it, which I think is the point) and understand. Using the “sort of” metaphor, websites can be thought of as a designed page which is comprised of things that it pretends to be, pretends not to be and what it really is. All the factors that make a website memorable or understandable to the user are made in separate parts, but when it all comes together into one holistic experience, the user’s unconsciousness should be able to form an idea of what they think the website is trying to do. The revealing relationship between form and content can be related to web design because to a certain degree, most websites are designed so that the structure of it reveals what the content of the web page is and how to experience it.
