		<h3>Website Response</h3>
		<p>
		<a href="https://nathan.tokyo" target="_blank">This</a> personal website acts as the owner’s resume and online portfolio. The website makes me feel adventurous and puts me in a fun mood because I am enticed to explore all the elements on the webpage. There is something very addictive about the elements on his webpage that make me want to keep on playing with them even if I know what will happen. The abundance of small animations which can be interacted with using our cursor tells me that the owner is a very playful person with a very good understanding of interactive design. The website feels ‘alive’ and the action of exploring his webpage allows us to explore his works and personality as well. I chose this website because I loved how each box/section has a different interaction that helps us understand the owner’s personality. I was attracted to the color scheme and the type as well. </p>
