		<em>all peeled where necessary and cut into small dice or rings:</em>
		<br>
		1 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; small onion,
		<br>
		1 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; small carrot, 
		<br>
		1 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; stick of celery, 
		<br>
		1 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; small leek, 
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
	</div>

	<p class="recipe">
		1. Cut Â¾ of the peeled beetroot into small dice <em>(you may want to wear rubber gloves to do this)</em> and set the rest aside. Melt the butter in a large pan, and then soften the onion over a gentle heat for 5 minutes.
		<br>
		<br>
		2. Add the carrot, leek, celery, diced beetroot, allspice and bay leaf and stir well to coat with butter. Cook for another 10 minutes, adding a little stock if the vegetables begin to look dry. Meanwhile, grate the remaining beetroot.
		<br>
		<br>
		3. Pour in the rest of the stock and the potatoes and simmer for 15 minutes, then add the cabbage, garlic and grated beetroot. Cook until all the vegetables are tender (about 10 minutes).
		<br>
		<br>
		4. Add the vinegar, sugar, pepper and a pinch of salt and taste. Add a little more of any of these if necessary, then serve with a dollop of sour cream, a sprig of dill, and some Polish bread on the side.
